# PrismaTech Development Strategy (PRIVATE)

## 🎯 **Current State: Landing Page + Waitlist**
- Static HTML/CSS/JS website
- Waitlist functionality with EmailJS + Google Sheets
- Hosted on Netlify
- Connected to GitHub for version control

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Enhanced Landing (Weeks 1-2)**

### **Immediate Improvements**
- [ ] Add Google Analytics
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for CTA buttons
- [ ] Add email validation improvements
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] SEO optimization

### **Waitlist Features**
- [ ] Email confirmation system
- [ ] Referral tracking
- [ ] Social sharing incentives
- [ ] Progress indicators

## 🏗️ **Phase 2: MVP Development (Weeks 3-8)**

### **Architecture Decision**
**Monorepo Approach (Recommended)**
```
prismatech/
├── apps/
│   ├── landing/          # Current static site
│   ├── web-app/          # Main PrismaTech application
│   └── admin/            # Admin dashboard
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/               # Shared UI components
│   ├── api/              # Backend API
│   └── shared/           # Shared utilities
└── docs/
```

### **Technology Stack Recommendation**
```
Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
Authentication: NextAuth.js
Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)
```

## 🎯 **Phase 3: Transition Strategy (Weeks 9-12)**

### **Landing Page → Main App Transition**

#### **Option 1: Gradual Migration (Recommended)**
1. **Week 9-10**: Build main app in `/app` route
2. **Week 11**: Add feature flags for gradual rollout
3. **Week 12**: Redirect landing page to main app

#### **Option 2: Subdomain Approach**
- `prismatech.co.uk` → Main application
- `landing.prismatech.co.uk` → Current landing page
- `app.prismatech.co.uk` → Main application

### **User Migration Strategy**
1. **Existing Waitlist Users**: Automatic account creation
2. **Email Notifications**: "Your PrismaTech account is ready!"
3. **Onboarding Flow**: Guided tour of new features
4. **Data Migration**: Waitlist emails → User accounts

## 🛠️ **Development Workflow**

### **Git Workflow**
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR to develop branch

# Staging deployment
git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin develop
# Auto-deploy to staging.prismatech.co.uk

# Production deployment
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
# Auto-deploy to prismatech.co.uk
```

### **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Local development
npm run build        # Production build
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Code linting

# Deployment
npm run deploy:staging    # Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:prod       # Deploy to production
```

## 📊 **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Current Landing Page**
- Google Analytics 4
- Netlify Analytics
- EmailJS conversion tracking
- Google Sheets waitlist data

### **Future Main App**
- User behavior analytics
- Performance monitoring (Vercel Analytics)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Business metrics dashboard

## 🔄 **Continuous Integration/Deployment**

### **Netlify Configuration**
```yaml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/app/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### **Landing Page KPIs**
- Waitlist signup rate
- Email open rates
- Social media engagement
- Page load speed

### **Main App KPIs**
